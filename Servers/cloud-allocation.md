<h3>Server and SAN allocation in the Tier 3 Public Cloud</h3>
<p>Tier 3 uses the cloud management platform to determine which host and SAN to allocate to a VM. &nbsp;As a result of this, the Tier 3 operations team is not able to accommodate requests to have VM's placed on specific hosts or SAN's. There are some innovative
  enhancements that are being put into the platform and please contact your account management team to discuss any needs that you might in relation to this KB or for a roadmap discussion.</p>
