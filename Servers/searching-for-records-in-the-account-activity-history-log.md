<p><strong>Description:</strong>
</p>
<p>All actions performed by users in the CenturyLink Cloud are recorded. The Tier 3 Activity Account History log can be viewed on the Tier 3 Control Portal or exported to as a CSV file for further analysis. This log includes the activities performed by users
  within an account and any sub-accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Steps:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<div><strong>1. View and filter the account history</strong>

  </li>
  <li>Add keywords to filter based on any text value within the log entry. Keyword filters are applied as an "AND" not an "OR", so all values in the keyword box must match the log entry. In the entry below, the user searched for any place where the words
    "Add" and "F" (for the F: drive) were in the log entry.
