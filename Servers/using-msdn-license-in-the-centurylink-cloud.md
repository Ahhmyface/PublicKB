###Discription
Change to MDSN licensing

CenturyLink Cloud provides SPLA licensing as a means of delivering cost-effective, utility computing. Customers may apply Microsoft or Red Hat enterprise licenses to their Virtual Machines and are billed the corresponding amount as long as the machine is in a live state. Customers who archive their servers do not pay for licensing until the Virtual Machine is placed back into production- archiving servers is a great way to manage costs while retaining operational agility. You may have seen [this article on using your Enterprise Agreement Licenses](../servers/using-your-microsoft-licenses-in-the-centurylink-cloud) (as long as you have a valid Software Assurance policy) in the CenturyLink Cloud.

###Recent Changes removes MDSN Licensing

In November 2014, Microsoft amended its MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network) package license terms to enable use of said licenses in only their Azure cloud and dedicated hosted environments. The ability to run MSDN licenses on third party clouds- such as CenturyLink Cloud has been removed by Microsoft.

"Active MSDN subscribers can install and run the software included in their subscription for development and testing purposes in a **dedicated hosted environment** provided by a SPLA partner. Alternatively, they may deploy the MSDN software on Azure. Any current MSDN subscriber who has activated their subscription is licensed to run the MSDN software (except for Windows and Windows Server) on Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines."

This information is subject to change. CenturyLink provides guidance on licenensing but ultimatly it is the responsibilty of the customer to ensure licensing compliance. Please consult your specific Microsoft license agreement or work with your Microsofot Licensing Representative for further clarification or updates.
