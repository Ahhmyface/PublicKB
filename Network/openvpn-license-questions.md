<p>There are several "different" OpenVPN products available.&nbsp; Some of them use completely free open source libraries and other do use some commercial libraries.&nbsp; Tier 3 uses software under this license:</p>

</p>
<p>What is not free for commercial use is the OpenVPN Access Server.&nbsp; That software contains a GUI for managing connections, creating VPN download bundles, etc.&nbsp; Tier 3 does not use this software, allowing everyone to be covered under the community
  supported edition.&nbsp; A comparison of the editions can be found here.</p>
