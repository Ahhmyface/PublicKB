<p>One of the benefits of the cloud is that customer do not have to worry about the hardware/ architecture layer that is underneath the platform. &nbsp;This being said, we do understand that customer are very interested in what hardware is being used and
  what the architecture looks like that supports the cloud infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Customers</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Architecture</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The cloud enables customers to achieve a level of agility that is normally not possible with traditional IT organizations. &nbsp;As such it is important that we are reviewing improving the architecture in order to leverage technology improvements. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>The current architecture version that is being deployed is version 4.</li>
</ol>
<div>
  <h3>The Hardware</h3> Tier 3 has a best-of-breed policy and selects the hardware in accordingly. The hardware is EOL'd somewhere between 3 and 5 years depending on the failure rate, maintenance schedules and contractual obligations. current vendors include:
  <ol>
    <li>Host vendors: Dell, HP, Supermicro, and OEM whitebox</li>
    <li>Storage vendors: SolidFire, Nimble, NetApp, Dell Equalogic, OEM whitebox</li>
    <li>Network vendors: Cisco, Juniper, Force10 and Arista</li>
    <li>Security vendors: &nbsp;For security reasons we do not disclose what tooling we are using.</li>
  </ol>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <em>Q. Can I select what hardware I want my servers to be running on?</em>
</div>
<div>A. In order to ensure that the customer server is receiving the best possible experience, the cloud platform as part of it's design does move&nbsp;servers to other hosts or storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, it is not possible for customers to select the hardware
  that is powering the cloud.</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Q. &nbsp;Can I connect my cloud servers to physical equipment located in other data centers?</em>
  <br />A. &nbsp;If there is layer 3 IP connectivity, it is possible to connect to your equipment&nbsp;located&nbsp;in CenturyLink&nbsp;data centers. &nbsp;Please contact your account management team to enable this connectivity. &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Q. &nbsp;Is it possible to be notified when the architecture is changed?</em>
</div>
<div>A. &nbsp;Currently we do not provide this option.</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Q. &nbsp;If I would like the cloud to use hardware provided by a specific vendor, how do I achieve this?</em>
</div>
<div>A. &nbsp;We select our hardware on a best-of-breed principle.</div>
