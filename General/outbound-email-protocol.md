###ctl.io Outbound Email Communication Protocol
April 2016

* The CenturyLink User Enablement & Product Teams produces the following Digital eZines. They are:
  * Ramp
  * View
  * Code
  * Link (Internal Only)
  * Orchestrate.io Monthly Newsletter
  * Managed Hosting Newsletter (Internal Only)
* The ctl.io Outbound Email Program following the principles of **Permission Based Marketing**. Individuals only received the eZines once **Explicit Consent** is obtained. Explicit Consent is obtained in the following ways:
  * The establish a new account on ctl.io thru the online activation mechanism.
  * The opt-into one of the *signup* widgets on ctl.io.
  * They were an existing customer of ctl.io at the time the Outbound Email Program was established.
* The ctl.io Outbound Email Program is fully compliant with US Anti-Spam Law, Canadian Anti-Spam Law (CASL) & European Union Regulations governing electronic communications (Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive). As such, all emails:
  * Clearly indicate the email is being sent by CenturyLink Cloud.
  * Contain a Unsubscrible Link.
  * A link to CenturyLink Cloud's Privacy Policy.
* In addition to the ctl.io Outbound Email Communications, our Customer Support Team will send out *Specical Announcments* with respect to the status of our platform or data centers.  For instance, our Customer Care Team will proactively send email communications to customers affected by planned maintainence or an incident ongoing in one of our data centers.
* Explicit Consent is also obtained for *Special Announcements*.  Consent is collected via the following vehicles for *Special Announcements*:
  * A user account is created on [Platform CenturyLink](https://control.ctl.io).
  * A user opts-in to receiving Customer Care *Special Announcements* via the ctl.io [Status Page](https://status.ctl.io).
* Consent between the eZines & *Special Announcements* is **not** inferred.
* The final type of email communication sent by the ctl.io team surrounds Product End Of Life messaging. We are legally bound to provide customer notification when a product(s) or service(s) they may be using is being terminated. In these cases, the responsible Product Owner(s) provide list of affected customers.
* **NOTE:** As we offer a platform that is easily customizable, many of our customers are resellers or internal corporate development groups who may not even know CenturyLink Cloud is powering their infrastructure. As a result, we make every effort NOT to send communications to reseller customers; however, if one of those customers adds an account directly on the platform, we will have no way of knowing to exclude them unless the reseller/corporate IT department informs us specifically

*VIEW: View brings you the latest information, news and views from the CenturyLink Cloud Platform team, including newly released products and features, Beta Programs, Events and more.

*CODE: Code is targeted to developers. In it we share tips, how-toâ€™s, code-snippets, tutorials and thought leadership, all aimed to foster developer productivity on our Cloud Platform.
