### The Basics

#### Definition

Onboarding is a process that we’ve developed to insure customers new to CenturyLink Cloud have an outstanding experience and a high degree of customer satisfaction.

#### Why Onboard?

A clearly, defined onboarding process improves the speed of implementation, accelerates revenue, ensures deeper understanding of the platform and reduces work load on operations and sales teams.

#### Onboarding Recommendations

We share our own best practices for customer onboarding so you can leverage them when you add new CenturyLink Cloud customers.


### Goals and Objectives


### Services Overview

There are generally four models of onboarding - titled “QuickStart” – customers can select to buy.  Here’s a summary of each model

**Quickstart Advanced (Default)**

Applicable to customers who need normal support over the first 30 days of their use of CenturyLink Cloud and/or would benefit from help building their environment.

**QuickStart Express**

Applicable to either very small customers (<$1000 MRR) or a customer that is very technically capable and needs only a little help.

**QuickStart Express for Free**

Applicable to customers who have requirements such as: onboardings that last more than 30 days, desire onsite workshops/training, require extended VM imports/builds.


### Customer Onboarding Overview

The QuickStart Onboarding process occurs in three phases – Kickoff, Implementation and Closure.  Each phase has a set of specific activities and outcomes.  During the course of a QuickStart, the onboarding Engineer will be the single point of contact during business hours.
