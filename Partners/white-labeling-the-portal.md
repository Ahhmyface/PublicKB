###What Is "White Labeling"?

"White Labeling the Portal" simply means you can remove specific CenturyLink brand elements and information and replace them with you own:

* site branding (logo, site name)
* color scheme
* email notifications
* customer support 

White Labeling does not mean modifying or changing in any way functional content (such as server functionality). For example, a CenturyLink Cloud partner cannot rewrite the portal in another language. 

###Site Branding

Go to the "Account" > "Settings" section. Then select "Site Branding."

####Change the Site Name

Click and replace the "Control Portal" name with any name of your choosing. Users of your account will now see the new name at the top of every page in the Control Portal.

####Customize the Logo

Like the site name, you can also customize the logo that appears on the sign in page, in the header of the Control Portal, and the favicon used by web browsers.
