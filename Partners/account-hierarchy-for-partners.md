### The Basics of Account Hierarchy

It’s important to understand the terminology and organizational framework of account hierarchy so you choose the structure that best fits your business needs.  Partner accounts are typically setup in the following manner: 

**Parent Account**

Also known as the root parent or master account. This is where you have visibility to the entire account hierarchy.  This is also where you white label your account, if you choose to do so.

**Partner Demo Account**

This is your demo account.  The demo account is designed so you can learn the platform and perform demos for customers. 

You have $3000 credit per month in this account. 

Note: Do not create a Customer Account in the Demo Account.  
Do not create Sub Accounts here either; if you do, the demo credit will not be applied. 


### Recommended Account Hierarchy

**Option 1: Flat Hierarchy**

The Flat Hierarchy is the most commonly used account structure.  Customer Accounts are created as Sub Accounts under the Parent Account.  User access is managed by the Customer Account. 

Advantages: Simple, straightforward approach.

Use Case: When customers manage their own accounts under one Parent Account.


- Acme Cloud (Parent Account)
  - Acme Cloud Demo Account
  - Customer 1
  - Customer 2
  - Customer 3
  
  
**Option 2: Partner Managed Account Hierarchy**

When a group of users are granted access at the Sub Account level “Partner Managed Accounts” enabling them to access and manage all accounts under the Parent Account

Customers who manage their own accounts will have separate permissions with this structure.

Advantages: Provides differentiated account management for partners who need it. 

Use Case: For partner teams who manage a set of customers and access AND also have customers who manage their own accounts.

  <p>Your account hierarchy defines how you create Sub Accounts in the CenturyLink Cloud portal. </p>
</div>

- Each Sub Account is logically isolated from other Sub Accounts within the parent account.
- Sub Accounts are hierarchical; user permissions flow down, not up or sideways. 
- Sub Accounts inherit users and permissions from the parent account.
Additional users can be added to the sub account. 


### Action Items

- Choose the account hierarchy that best meets your business needs and those of your customers.
- Communicate this information to the Onboarding Manager.  
- Use this account hierarchy when adding new customers (i.e., Sub Accounts).
