**Minimizing Restore Costs**

We understand that optimization of your budget is important and are constantly working towards offering an effective service at a reduced price. In conjunction with this goal, roadmap items exist for lowering overall restore costs and providing partial restores to help minimize the the return of unnecessary data during a restore. In addition, there are a few tips and tricks that are able to be utilized to assist with minimizing restore costs.

-   Policy Strategy - Instead of creating a policy to backup all the required files on a server, create multiple policies to backup separate directories. Not only will this tactic help to minimize the amount of data returned on restores, but also increase the backup & restore speeds.

-   Maximize Exclusions - If there are files/folders that are unnecessary to backup, be sure to specify an exclusion in your policy. Optimization of exclusions will reduce backup & restore costs while also increasing backup & restore speeds.

-   Utilize the Default Restore Folder - While sifting through recently restored data, it is best practice to leave the files in the default restore folder until ready to replace existing files. The default restore folder is automatically excluded from backups to prevent duplication of backup data.
