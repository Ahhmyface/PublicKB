### Give Admin Access to Cloud Application Manager
When you sign up for the Cloud Application Manager Enterprise Edition, you get a default administrator account that lets you globally manage settings for all Cloud Application Manager users in your organization. Besides the default account, you can give any Cloud Application Manager user administrator access through the admin console under Organization > Administrators.

**To Give Admin Access**
1. Log in to Cloud Application Manager as the default administrator.
2. Go to the Admin Console located in menu drop-down at the top right corner of your workspace.

3. Under **Organization > Administrators**, type the user’s name in the search field and select to add them.<br>

To revoke administrator privileges for a user, click X against their name under **Organization > Administrators**.

Administrators can manage several org-wide settings that include [user authentication](./user-authentication.md), the [ElasticBox appliance](./appliance-overview.md), [provider access](./provider-access.md), [admin boxes](./deploymentpolicy-box.md), [webhooks](./webhooks.md), and [instance tags](./resource-tags.md). To get a good idea of things you can do, see [Overview](./admin-overview.md).
