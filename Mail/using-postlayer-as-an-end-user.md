<p>What is PostLayer?</p>
<p>Postlayer is an intelligent Spam, Virus, and Phishing filter.</p>

<p>How do I log in?</p>
<p>Log in at <a href="https://admin.postlayer.com/">https://admin.postlayer.com/</a>. Click Password Help if you need to reset your Postlayer login.</p>

<p>Once you are logged in you have several options available.</p>
<p><strong>Quarantine</strong>: This is where messages go that were considered spam. Select a message and hit Deliver to have it arrive in your inbox. If you need to permanently allow a sender or a sender's domain, you can do that at "Allow &amp;
  Block List" Under Policies.</p>
<p><strong>Summary Settings</strong>: This is where you can customize your Quarantine delivery messages. These inform you that email(s) have not been delivered to your inbox.</p>

<p><strong>Filtering</strong>: It is recommended to leave these settings at default. Consult with your Administrator if you need help with these settings.</p>

<p><strong>Policies</strong>: Allow Block List: Using the Allow box, you can add either individual emails(test@microsoft.com) or entire email domains(microsoft.com) to your Allow list. Adding a user or domain to this list will allow all traffic regardless of the
  content. Using the Block box, you can add users or domains to your Block list which will Quarantine all messages from the user or domain.</p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong>: Delegates: Here you can specify an alternate recipient for your Quarantine messages. This is useful for managing Distribution Lists so that all members do not receive a Quarantine message.</p>
