<p>You must know a couple of things before you get started:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Your OWA URL.</li>
  <li>Your username &amp; email address.</li>
  <li>Your Email password</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://exchange.mycompany.com/owa">https://exchange.mycompany.com/owa</a>&nbsp; /owa is required in most cases</li>
  <li>Mycompany\myusername&nbsp; - It can also be in form of your email address: me@domain.com</li>
</ol>
<p>Connect to your OWA website, and input your username and password. It will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://t3n.zendesk.com/attachments/token/hjqelb1kvoghczw/?name=LoginScreen.png" alt="LoginScreen.png" />
</p>
<p>On the login page there are a couple of optional selections you can make.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Public or Private computer:&nbsp;
    <ol>
      <li>When public is chosen your session will time out much quicker.&nbsp; If you were to accidentally stay logged in at a public location, OWA will try and protect you if your session has been idle for a few minutes (this time-out is configured by Exchange
        administrators).&nbsp; It is still recommended to log out when you are done.</li>
      <li>When Private is chosen your session will stay active for a longer period of time.&nbsp; This is meant for home or personal laptop use where there is no risk of someone accessing your e-mail.</li>
      <li>Light version of Outlook Web App.&nbsp; This is recommended if you are using slow internet or out of date browsers.&nbsp; Less bandwidth is used and many features are disabled</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once logged into OWA you have a fully functional Email application.&nbsp; You can send and receive email, view and modify your Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks.&nbsp;</p>
