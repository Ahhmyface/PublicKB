<p>Note: Most organizations have certain password requirements.&nbsp; If you are receiving an error along these lines, try a stronger password (Upper/lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and longer length).&nbsp; You can consult your Exchange administrator
  for exact requirements.&nbsp; See: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc875814.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc875814.aspx</a> for more information on password requirements and implementation.</p>
