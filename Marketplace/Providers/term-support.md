The  marketplace can support both term and commits associated with sales lead  transactions.  We are able to ensure a marketplace transaction for software does not end  before your commit date. If you or your organization is involved in a marketplace transaction that has a term or commitassociated with it, associated with it, you will need to let the marketplace know about it know about it so they can add a term attribute to the subscription.  It is up to the sales staff members leading the marketplace transaction to inform the marketplace team that they commit is associated with a particular subscription.  A term or commit cannot cannot be added to a disabled subscription.
