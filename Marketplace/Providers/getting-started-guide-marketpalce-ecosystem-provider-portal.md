The Ecosystem Provider Portal &ndash; or EPP &ndash; is an application that allows CenturyLink Cloud Provider Partners to manage the display of their products on the CenturyLink Marketplace. Once an Ecosystem Provider has certified a product, a member of the Ecosystem Team will provide the partner with a welcome email with the credentials to log-in to EPP.

### Signing In

Sign into the [Provider Portal](http://provider-portal.staging.ctl.io/#/login) using your credentials. You will be redirected to the Welcome screen.

To add a new product simply click the green **add product** button.

As desired, you may provide other supplemental information for your product, including:

* **Dependencies** (optional).

Click **Preview in Marketplace** at the top of the form.

### Adding End User License Agreements(EULA)

To add the (EULA) sign in to the EPP and navigate to the **Product** tab in the top navigation bar.
This will take you to the product details page for your company.

Sign in to the EPP and navigate to the **Product** tab in the top navigation bar.
This will take you to the product details page for your company.

![EPP10](../images/EPP10.png)

**Q: What if I forget my User Name?**

**A:** Reach out to the [CenturyLink help desk](mailto:help@ctl.io).

**Q: What markdown is accepted by EPP?**

**A:** Most markdown formatting is recognized. See the [markdown-it](https://markdown-it.github.io/), the GitHub markdown editor, for more detail.

**Q: What types of image files can be used for Company and Product logos?**

**A:** Files must be 1MB or smaller. EPP accepts the following image file types: PNG, BMP, JPG or GIF.

**Q: How long after I click Request Publication at the bottom of a Product Details form can I expect my product to be published?**

**A:** Within 2 business days, the CenturyLink Cloud Marketplace Team will approve and publish your product. At that point, it will be fully available for customers in the [Marketplace](https://www.ctl.io/marketplace/).

**Q: On a Product Detail page, why are there three different ways to Preview my content? What's the difference?**

A:

1.	**Form Fields: Edit vs. Preview**

Selecting **Preview** above a form field lets you see how the markdown you entered for that field will render. Below is how markdown content will render in **Edit** mode.

  ![EPP12](../images/EPP12.png)

Here's how that same content appears when rendered in **Preview** mode.

  ![EPP13](../images/EPP13.png)

2.	**Product Details Page: Edit vs. Preview**

Clicking the **Preview** button at top or bottom of the **Product Details** page allows you to see the whole page rendered, as opposed to just single elements.


Below is what it looks like in **Edit** mode.

![EPP14](../images/EPP14.png)

Now let's see what it looks like in **Preview** mode.

![EPP15](../images/EPP15.png)

These modes are helpful to check your overall markdown, however, it is still not how the customer will see your product.

3. **Preview in Marketplace**

Clicking **Preview** in Marketplace at the top of the form allows you to view exactly how your product will be presented on the Marketplace to customers.

![EPP16](../images/EPP16.png)

Here's how that same product will appear in Marketplace (**preview mode**).

![EPP17](../images/EPP17.png)

Once you're in the Marketplace **preview mode**, you can also click switch to **published mode**, but only after your product has been published.

**Q: I clicked “switch to published mode” but see a 404 page. Why am I getting this error?**

![EPP18](../images/EPP18.png)

**A:** You may have already completed your data entry and requested publication, but your product won’t be viewable in published mode until the CenturyLink Cloud Marketplace Team has approved and published it.
