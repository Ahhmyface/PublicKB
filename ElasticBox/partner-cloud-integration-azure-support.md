###Overview

Partner Cloud Integration allows an ElasticBox user to create Azure Customer Accounts for which CenturyLink will provide Platform-level support. The following is a description of what platform-level support is and how to use it.

### Audience

All of our customers are invited to use Cloud Integration.

### Prerequisites

Knowledge of ElasticBox's [partner cloud integration](../ElasticBox/partner-cloud-integration.md) feature.

Knowledge of how to [get started with cloud-integrated Azure](../ElasticBox/partner-cloud-integration-azure-new.md)

### Important Information

**Contact Information**

To submit a support request, you may do so via the following methods:

* Call 844-874-5167. This is a US domestic toll free number.
* Email CloudSupport@centurylink.com
* Submit a support request via MSP Portal

**Scope of Support**

In the table below, Platform-level support (in bold) is juxtaposed with un-managed support and Managed OS so the customer has clear expectations for what kind of support they will receive.

It is possible to expect all levels of support in the same environment. For instance, a user may load an un-managed application onto a Managed OS which exists within CenturyLink's Azure CSP purview. Installing an un-supported application within a Managed OS or managed environment does not cause CenturyLink's support responsibilities to transfer to that application.  

Type of Support | Definition | Scope of CenturyLink Support
--- | --- | ---
Un-managed | Support for resources a customer might have anywhere in the world which do not have a Managed Operating System, are not within CenturyLink's re-seller authority, or do not have a contract for support. This includes Azure customer accounts that are not created by [ElasticBox's ARM Provider](../ElasticBox/partner-cloud-integration-azure-new.md) or brought under CenturyLink's reseller authority by an agreement with the customer. | *IN SCOPE*: Nothing; *OUTSIDE SCOPE*: Everything. The customer must provide support for un-managed resources
**Platform-Level** | **CenturyLink becomes the first responder to any issues related to permitted resources within re-sold (CSP) Azure customer accounts and the ability to use those resources via normal means.** | ** *IN SCOPE*: See the list below. *OUTSIDE SCOPE*: Remote Administration, Monitoring and Remediation, Change Management and Patching **
Managed OS | The objective of this service is to provide Remote Administration, Monitoring, ticketing specific to the resources, and Patching for the OS. (For the moment, this in-depth level of support for Windows and RedHat OS-es are not available in Azure.)|  *IN SCOPE*: Operating System support, including Remote Administration, Monitoring and Remediation, Change Management and Patching; *OUTSIDE SCOPE*: Infrastructure.
