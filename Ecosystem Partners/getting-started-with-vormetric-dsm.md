### Description

### Solution Overview

The Vormetric Data Security Manager (DSM) is the brain of the Vormetric Data Security Platform. The Data Security Manager changes the data security management game by enabling an IT organization to have a consistent and repeatable method for encrypting, enforcing access policies and gaining security intelligence for all structured and unstructured data. Once the Data Security Manager is in place, new security mandates, compliance requirements and risks are quickly met through the provisioning of Vormetric Transparent Encryption, Vormetric Application Encryption, or managing keys and certificates for 3rd party devices. The result of centralizing control of such a breadth of data-at-rest security capabilities is low total cost of ownership, efficient deployment of new secure services, and an increase in control and visibility of data across your organization.
