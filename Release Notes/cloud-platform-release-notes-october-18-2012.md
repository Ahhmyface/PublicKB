<p><strong>New Features (2)</strong>
</p>
<hr />
<ul>
  <li><strong>Firewall Policies</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;New in this release, and <strong>currently only available for CenturyLink Cloud Administrators</strong>, firewall policies allow users to create and maintain complex intra-DC networking policies. Administrators can
    use these policies to define how network traffic should go between the vlans that exist in their primary account and various sub-accounts. <strong>In the very near future, this feature will be opened up for CenturyLink Cloud customers to use</strong>. For more
    information, please see the following Knowledge Base articles: <a href="http://help.tier3.com/entries/22196842-connecting-data-center-networks-through-firewall-policies" target="_blank">Connecting Data Center Networks Through Firewall Policies</a>    and <a href="http://help.tier3.com/entries/22210896-creating-bi-directional-firewall-policies" target="_blank">Creating Bi-Directional Firewall Policies</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>"Script" Tasks on Groups</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Task can be applied in blueprints and as part of Group-level actions. It supports the execution of user-entered script statements for Windows (PowerShell and Command) and Linux (SSH). This
    allows users to quickly and easily perform group-level activities such as turning off a service or enabling a firewall rule.</li>
