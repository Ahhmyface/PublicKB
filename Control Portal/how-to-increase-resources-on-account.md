### Description
CenturyLink Cloud accounts start with a pre-defined resource (CPU, memory, storage, Public-IP) limit per data center. As customers grow their cloud usage, it's common to request an increase in resource limits. Other items to note about increasing resources:
* A single request can be made to Customer Care without additional CenturyLink authorization, if it doesn't exceed 50% of current resource limit.
* After the first resource limit increase in a given 30-day period, each subsequent increase request is subject to an internal review prior to approval.
* Only paying customers can have their resource limits increased, unless executive approval is given.

### Resource Notification
When building a new machine you receive a Control Portal error message indicating a lack of resources (CPU, Memory, Storage).

1. Please contact Support via email: <a href="mailto:help@ctl.io">help@ctl.io</a>
2. Inform them that you have reached your resource limitations.
3. The Engineer validates your identity and then increase your limit.
4. Once the Engineer increases the resources on your account, you then must take following steps inside the Control Portal to apply them to the correct data center.

### Steps
1. From the Navigation Menu, select **Orchestration > Servers**.

2. Select the proper data center that needs the additional resources.

3. Click the **Settings** tab.

4. Scroll down to the **Resource Limits** section.

5. Click on the resource (e.g., CPU, memory, storage) and increase the limit.

6. Click **Save**.
