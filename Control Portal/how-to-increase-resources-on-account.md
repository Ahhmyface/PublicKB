<h3>Description&nbsp;</h3>
<p>CenturyLink Cloud accounts start with a pre-defined resource (CPU/memory/storage) limit per data center. As customers grow their cloud usage, it's common to request an increase in resource limits.&nbsp; &nbsp;Note that only paying customers will have
  their resource limits increased unless executive approval is given.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Detailed Steps</h3>
<p>1. &nbsp;You get an error in the upper right hand corner of Control indicating lack of resources (CPU, Memory, Storage) when you are building a new machine.</p>
