Public Knowledge Base
========

Welcome to [CenturyLink Cloud](http://www.centurylinkcloud.com) knowledge base repository. This is the source of information on all of our products and services available today. Please follow the guidelines below to contribute or make changes.

##How this Works

* **Headers:** The system uses Jekyll _(like)_ headers to be able to list current information and also track things such as author, date created, modified, keywords, title, etc.

```code
---
title: Blogging Like a Hacker
author: Joe Smith
keywords: cat, foo, bar, nice, crack, fun
categories: Hyperscale, VMStandard
permlink: /blogging-like-a-hacker
---
```

* **Markdown:** It is also built using all markdown for the documents. For more information about markdown please use [Google](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS503US504&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=markdown%20syntax)

* **Folder Structure:** folders are by products and should remain that way. If you want your document to be supported in multiple categories please use the headers to list all of the categories it is in. All image and assets should be located in the local product folder or in a folder next to the document. It should not be on the root of the directory structure. 



##How to Make Changes

To make any changes please submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). Once a pull request is accepted it will be live within the next 1-2 hours to our public web site. This also allows for rolling back a commit and making changes with history tracking.
