# IMPORTANT NOTE

AppFog v2, the upcoming CenturyLink Cloud integrated public Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), is not available to all customers at this time. We are current in a Limited Beta program with specific customers. AppFog v2 will be available in Open Beta later in 2015.

The current AppFog service at [http://www.appfog.com/](http://www.appfog.com/) is still available and will continue to be in service even after AppFog v2 is made generally available. Please feel free to sign up for the current AppFog service [here](https://console.appfog.com/signup).
