# IMPORTANT NOTE

# Audience

Currently, this article is to support customers in the Limited Beta program.

# AppFog Overview

AppFog is a public Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that makes deploying scalable, robust, high performing [cloud-ready applications](http://12factor.net) fast and easy for developers. AppFog enables developers to focus on writing great applications without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. The result is increased agility and productivity, more efficient use of resources, and a simplified deployment and management experience.

# Enable AppFog in Control Portal

*NOTE: The following steps will only work for customers with CenturyLink Control Portal accounts enabled for the Limited Beta program.*

Go to https://control.ctl.io, login, and see “AppFog" listed in the drop down navigation bar:

![AppFog in Dropdown Navigation](../images/appfogv2/appfog-in-dropdown-nav.png)

You may also navigate to AppFog via the icon on the left-side vertical navigation bar:

![AppFog icon in Vertical Navigation](../images/appfogv2/appfog-icon-nav.png)

Navigate to AppFog using either navigation approach and now it is time to create an AppFog Organization unless someone else has done so for your Control Portal account. You will know that an AppFog Organization has been created for your account if there is no “create org” button and instead it looks something like the following:

If the AppFog Organization has not been created for your account, then click the "create org" button:
