Overview
<p>CenturyLink provides reactive patching to managed customer operating systems.&nbsp; Patches and updates are available upon request to ensure that no patches are applied without customer knowledge and consent, effectively reducing risks to application
  and data integrity.</p>
<p>On a monthly basis, CenturyLink product engineers review all vendor-recommended patches made available by operating system software vendors.&nbsp; A subset of these patches and updates are identified by the OS vendor as <strong>Critical</strong> or <strong>Important</strong>  to installed operating systems, and this subset is tested and certified by CenturyLink.&nbsp; All certified and vendor-recommended patches are implemented with new server builds and made available for patching upon customer request for existing managed
  servers.</p>
<p>As part of our cloud service, CenturyLink will work with a designated customer representative to install requested certified patches according to available maintenance windows.&nbsp; Since CenturyLink is often not responsible for the customer’s entire
  application tier, CenturyLink cannot be responsible for any adverse effects from patches that are installed at the request of the customer.&nbsp; Once requested patching has been applied, standardized reporting is available to each customer through
  the CenturyLink customer web portal to indicate all patches successfully or unsuccessfully applied.</p>
Service Packs and Sub Releases
<p>All service packs are evaluated and tested thoroughly on the standard CenturyLink Cloud Managed Server configurations. Integration of the service pack, into the CenturyLink hardened standard operating system build, only occurs once testing has proven
  its stability and performance benefits.&nbsp; All applicable new managed servers will be automatically configured with this new base build.&nbsp; CenturyLink intends to keep in production current level N-2 to the extent that the underlying vendor is
  still providing patching and support.&nbsp; When underlying vendor support ceases to exist, CenturyLink&nbsp; will be liable for best effort service and patching up to the last available support structure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Existing production servers, if
  requested by the customer, will be upgraded during maintenance windows that will be coordinated with the customer.</p>
Anti-Virus Protection
<p>Standard CenturyLink practice shall be that anti-virus software is provided automatically with each managed Microsoft Windows OS.&nbsp; CenturyLink uses third-party anti-virus software in conjunction with centralized management tools to maintain anti-virus
  software updates, policy control and regular signature file updates per the policies defined at the AV vendor’s central management server.&nbsp; Anti-virus technology provides reasonable protection against malware, including viruses, spyware and trojans,
  but such technology cannot guarantee the prevention of such malware. Should disruption or changes occur due to malware, CenturyLink will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly remedy the situation after being notified of the problem, but CenturyLink
  will not be responsible for any damages due to worms, phishing attacks, rootkits, trojan horses or other such malware, including infection of end-user devices or lost or corrupted data/messages.</p>
