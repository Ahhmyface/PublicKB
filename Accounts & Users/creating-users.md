  <li>Once a user is created an email will be sent to the email address supplied with the required information for logging in.</li>
</ul>

##API Users
You can manage users for version 1 of the API on your account by going to the Control Portal &gt; Account &gt; API.

* Click on the "Create API User" button.
* Enter an email address. &nbsp;The entered email address must be unique.
* NOTE: API users have full permission to account resources, and as such do not need permissions configured.
* NOTE: API v2 users control portal users rather than an API specific user.
