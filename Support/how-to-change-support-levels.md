### Overview
CenturyLink Cloud offers three different types of [Support Levels](https://www.ctl.io/support/):
* Developer (Default for customers who have signed up via the web)
* Professional (Default option for contracts)
* Enterprise (Premier level of support)

### Determine Your Current Support Level
1. Determine your current Support Level by logging into the [Control Portal](https://control.ctl.io), then click "Settings" and "Account Settings".

2. Click on Support under the Settings Tab.

### Change your Support Level
You can request a change to your Support level by sending an email to [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io) with the following information:
* Account Alias to be changed
* Support Level (Developer, Professional, or Enterprise)
* Your Control account username and [account PIN](https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/support/pin-authentication-for-support-requests/) for security verification purposes

Your email will generate a ticket to the Customer Care team, who may reach out for further information. You will receive a confirmation once the change has been made to the account.
