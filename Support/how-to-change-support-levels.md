### Overview
CenturyLink Cloud offers three different [Support Levels](https://www.ctl.io/support/):
* Developer (Default for customers who have signed up via the web)
* Professional (Default option for contracts)
* Enterprise (Premier level of support)

### Determine Your Current Support Level
1. To determine your current Support Level, log into the [Control Portal](https://control.ctl.io), click "Settings" and then "Account Settings".

2. Click "Support" on the Settings Tab.

### Change your Support Level
If you wish to request a change to your Support Level, send an email to [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io) and include the following information:
* Account Alias to be changed
* Support Level (Developer, Professional, or Enterprise)
* Your Control account username and [account PIN](https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/support/pin-authentication-for-support-requests/) for security verification purposes

Your email will generate a ticket to the Customer Care team, who may contact you for further information. You will receive  confirmation when the change has been made to the account.
