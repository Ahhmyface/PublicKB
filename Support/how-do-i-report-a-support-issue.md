<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
<div>Q. &nbsp;I have an email thread with my sales team on this issue. &nbsp;Why is this not being worked?</div>
<div>A. The CenturyLink Cloud support staff do not use email to provide support. &nbsp;All issues are tracked in the ZenDesk ticketing system.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Q. &nbsp;I have an old ticket, let's just reopen the ticket.</div>
<div>A. &nbsp;When you reopen a ticket, it goes to the engineer that solved. &nbsp;Our engineers work shifts and therefore it is possible that engineer is off shift. &nbsp;In this case, the ticket update may never be seen for days because they are off.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Q. How long do you wait before closing a ticket?</div>
<div>A. After a ticket has been Solved, the automation will close the the ticket after 3 days. &nbsp;All subsequent communication to the closed ticket will create a new ticket at Low priority.</div>
