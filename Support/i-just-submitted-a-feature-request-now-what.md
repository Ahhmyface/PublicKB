<p>We encourage submissions on feature requests from customers either through our email alias (features@tier3.com) or via our interactive portal (<a href="http://centurylinkcloud.uservoice.com/">http://centurylinkcloud.uservoice.com</a>). &nbsp;More detail
  about that process is <a href="https://t3n.zendesk.com/entries/21699874-How-do-I-submit-a-feature-request-" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>So what happens once ideas are submitted, here is the process.</p>
<p>1. Each item is reviewed by a cross-section of stakeholders, lead by our product ownership team.</p>
<p>2. The item is either rejected or accepted. &nbsp;A decision is either reached immediately, or is postponed to allow for "community" feedback based on a larger external audience.</p>
<p>3. The decision - and subsequent discussion - are tracked on the original thread to close the loop (either via ticket or UserVoice item).</p>
<p>4. The status of "accepted" items is not systematically available. &nbsp;This is due to the fluid, agile nature of our development cycle. &nbsp;Note that a backlog of accepted items is regularly reviewed and prioritized.</p>
<p>5. Release notes with new capabilities are published after every development cycle.</p>
