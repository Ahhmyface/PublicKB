<p><strong>&nbsp;Description (goal/purpose)</strong>
</p>
<p>CenturyLinkCloud utilizes Zendesk <a href="http://t3n.zendesk.com/">http://t3n.zendesk.com</a> for ticketing. This allows for email updates, and the ability to view ticket status in the web interface, as well as viewing CenturyLinkCloud Knowledge Base
  articles. A free&nbsp;account with Zendesk is required for access. This is different than your CenturylinkCloud account.</p>
