<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>CenturyLink Cloud has the capability for customers to report issues via the phone or chat. &nbsp;All incoming phone calls and chats are initially classified as a low priority ticket. &nbsp;If you are experiencing a critical, issue, it is far more expedient
  to open an appropriately prioritized ticket via the ticket automation system. &nbsp;There are engineers available and working the queues 24x7.</p>
