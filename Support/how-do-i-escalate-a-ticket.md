<h3>Description (goal/purpose)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I have submitted a support request and need it to be executed&nbsp;immediately.</li>
  <li>I have submitted a ticket and would like to escalate it.</li>
  <li>CenturyLink Cloud did not deliver or perform what they committed to deliver in a ticket.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Customers who have a paid support contract</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pre-Requisites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Please DO NOT forward a previous ticket to this mechanism because the automation will add your email to that ticket.</li>
  <li>Ticket number of the ticket that describes the issue in detail. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Please review the ticket prioritization matrix that can be found here: &nbsp;https://t3n.zendesk.com/entries/21651149-Ticket-Prioritization-Matrix</li>
  <li>Please ensure that this issue being escalated&nbsp;requires escalation. &nbsp;The majority of the escalation team reside in Seattle and please be aware of the time when you escalate. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Please have someone available to respond to any information request from CenturyLink Cloud. &nbsp;The majority of the time, these requests will be made via the original ticket. &nbsp;Not having someone available could delay the resolution of the issue
    and defeats the purpose of the escalation mechanism.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Detailed Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Please review the Ticket Prioritization Matrix so that you understand what priority your ticket should be.</li>
  <li>email escalation@t3n.zendesk.com&nbsp;with the following information:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Subject: ESCALATION: Ticket - &lt;your ticket number&gt;</li>
    <li>Message Body: Your message and a brief explanation of why you are escalating the ticket.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>A ticket will be created in our system for your escalation and it will be automatically escalated to the CenturyLink Cloud operations management.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Q &amp; A</h3>
<div>
  <div><strong>Q</strong>&nbsp;- Is this capability available 24x7?</div>
  <div><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;- Yes, while the management team that responds to these requests is based on the USA West Coast, they do respond to escalations within 15 minutes. **The exception is an escalation for Service Tasks, which are only acknowledged
    from 7am-7pmPT.</div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div>
    <div><strong>Q</strong>&nbsp;- What criteria are used to evaluate a Service Request escalation request?</div>

    <div><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;- The members of the escalation team are members of the CenturyLink Cloud Support Management team. &nbsp;They will review the age of the original ticket, clarity of information in the original ticket, scope, skill level and
      time of day of the request.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
  </div>
  <div></div>
</div>
<div><strong>Q</strong> - Will I be charged for escalating a&nbsp;ticket?</div>
<div><strong>A</strong> - In general no; however for parties that misuse the escalation mechanism, CenturyLink Cloud does reserve the right to charge.</div>
<div>

    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div></div>
  </div>
  <div><strong>Q</strong>&nbsp;- I do not have a paid support contract, what will happen when I use this mechanism?&nbsp;</div>
  <div><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;- The automation will check to validate your contract and if you do not have a support contract, your escalation will not complete successfully. &nbsp;</div>
