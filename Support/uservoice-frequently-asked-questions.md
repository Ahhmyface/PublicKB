## Overview

CenturyLink Cloud's UserVoice site is an interactive channel. Here, customers can suggest feature enhancements, and vote on the ideas of others.

### How do I get access?

Submit a ticket to [noc@ctl.io](mailto:noc@ctl.io) requesting access to UserVoice. The login page is available [here](http://centurylinkcloud.uservoice.com/forums/207923-feature-suggestions).

### Can I encourage others from my company to sign-up for UserVoice?
Yes, there is no specific limit on number of users per company.

### How long will it take for my suggestions to get evaluated?

They are regularly reviewed and triaged by a cross-functional team at CenturyLink Cloud. There is no specific SLA for a decision, however. In general, we do like to see the community’s reaction and response to new suggestions.

### I’d like to know what’s in the current sprint, or what’s in a specific future sprints. Will UserVoice tell me that?

Status of ideas are regularly updated as the product roadmap progresses. “Supporters” of a specific feature are automatically emailed with an update once status has changed.

However, specific items that are included in a given sprint are not explicitly tracked. Release Notes that summarize enhancements are posted online [here](.)
